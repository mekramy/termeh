# Core Concepts

The foundation of all components, styles, and functions in Termeh lies in its core, which provides a set of configurable variables and essential helper functions.

The core includes utilities for color management, such as contrast calculation, luminance analysis, and dynamic generation of color palettes. These functions help ensure accessible and visually harmonious UI designs.

In addition, Termeh's core provides helpers for layout and structure, including grid system utilities, responsive design helpers, and text styling functions. These tools allow developers to build flexible, scalable, and consistent interfaces with ease.

Each section below dives deeper into these core features, showing how to leverage Termeh's built-in functions and mixins to create modern, modular, and maintainable UIs.
